# Getting Started with the Cyrpto App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

How the application works

1. Fetch  24hr Ticker Price Change Statistics using `/api/v3/ticker/24hr`
2. You can search price changes also for a certain cryptocurrency by symbol name eg. `ETHBTC`
3. Endpoint used to test the API Authentication is `/sapi/v1/accountSnapshot` it displays user data and can be found on this route `/account`

## Note I was not able to create API key as it requiresa deposit.
